procedure
===
1) Measure out granulated sugar, then raw sugar, into bowl of mixer.
2) Melt butter in small pot over medium heat until milk solids turn hazelnut-brown. You can stop at peanut-butter-brown if you’re afraid of burning it.
3) Immediately pour butter into mixer bowl while it’s still hot. This helps dissolve the sugars.
4) Now add the molasses. The butter prevents the molasses from sticking to the bowl.
5) Mix on ~40% speed with whisk attachment while you do the dry stuff. This gives it time to cool so the eggs don’t cook when we add them.
6) If you’re feeling ambitious, you can sift the flour, otherwise just dump it into a new bowl.
7) Add the rest of the dry ingredients to the flour and whisk together.
8) Hopefully our butter stuff will be somewhat cooler now. Add vanilla, egg, and yolk. Keep mixing. Make sure there are no pockets of sugar at the bottom of the bowl.
9) Switch to paddle attachment (or use a spoon/spatula) and mix the wet & dry stuff together.
10) Once you can’t see any more dry ingredient powder, incorporate the choc. chips and nuts.
11) Turn the oven on and set to 350F.
12) While that’s preheating, put the dough in the fridge for about 30 minutes.
13) Scoop the cookies onto the cookie sheet (or SilPat), about 1/8 to 1/4 cup per cookie, depending on how big you like them. Put the dough back in the fridge.
14) Sprinkle your finishing salt on the top. 1 pinch should cover 2-3 cookies.
15) Bake for ~13 minutes. I like air-bake sheets; solid sheets cook slightly faster. Use your first batch as a tester for the rest.
16) Take the sheet out of the oven, but leave them on the sheet until you need it next - the residual heat helps set the chocolate and prevent smearing. Ideally, you’d alternate between two sheets, one in and one out.

Enjoy!
